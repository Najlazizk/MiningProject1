Supermarkets are very important they play a huge role in our everyday life basics it Keep the community fed, act as social hubs in many communities, offer a place to limit the amount of chemicals or hormones in our food, and increase the number of jobs in the community. Many believe that having a supermarket store is not only an essential thing but also a part of the culture. Without a grocery store that ponds the community as shoppers or consumers, we cannot sustain the livelihood of the community. The concept of it is such that it brings an income to the society, gives an opportunity for local brands to grow with bigger ones, and has the community growing, this would be the reason why we chose to work with this important dataset.
